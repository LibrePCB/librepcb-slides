\section{Why not contributing to KiCad?}

\begin{frame}{\secname}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Very different underlying concepts}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Mindset/opinions often can't be changed by contributors
      \item Fundamentally changing concepts is \textit{very} hard since an
            upgrade mechanism needs to be provided
    \end{itemize}

    \bigskip

    \item \textbf{Different priorities / target audience}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item KiCad: Feature-rich, professional-grade, flexibility
            (can do everything)
      \item LibrePCB: Usability, intuitive UI, portability, stability,
            version controlability
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
