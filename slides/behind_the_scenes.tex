  \note<1>{
    Let's take a look at what happened in the past one or two years, because
    there are some great news.\\

    Especially the end of 2022 was an exciting moment because I started to
    work full-time on LibrePCB, now doing it for more than a year. Of course
    this leads to a lot more progress than in the years before.
  }

  \note<2>{
    In addition, the LibrePCB project has been accepted by the NLnet foundation
    to receive funding through the Next Generation Internet initiative, which
    helps a lot to keep the full-time development ongoing.
  }

  \note<3>{
    Then our fabrication service got PCBway as a new manufacturing partner,
    so if you order a PCB through LibrePCB Fab you can now choose between
    AISLER and PCBway.
  }

  \note<4>{
    Also I'm very proud to have several new sponsors on board:
    Bittele Electronics, NextPCB, Partstack, PCBgogo and WIN SOURCE.
  }

  \note<5>{
    Last but not least, there are many individuals supporting the LibrePCB
    project with donations or other kinds of contributions.
  }

  \note<6>{
    With these sponsorships and donations, the LibrePCB project raised around
    8000 dollars in 2023, which is pretty amazing in my opinion.\\

    So at this point I want to thank all the supporters and contributors for
    your trust into the LibrePCB project, this really makes me happy. Thank
    you so much. I take that as a sign that LibrePCB is on the right way.\\

    Nevertheless, it's still a long way to go until we have a stable
    funding for the full-time development, so I hope this support lasts many
    more years.
