\section{Challenges}

\begin{frame}{\secname}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Learning many new things (web dev., server admin, video editing,
          macOS, \ldots)
    \item Missing/incomplete/unclear standards (pick\&place, Gerber, IPC7351,
          \ldots)
    \item Part libraries (huge effort, complex cases, STEP licenses)
    \item Platform specific issues (desktop integration, themes, sandboxing,
          \ldots)
    \item GUI toolkit limitations
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\note{
  A project of this complexity is not just writing code, there are many more
  things needed to create a successful project.\\

  For example, although originally I was just a C++ developer, the LibrePCB
  project enforced me to learn web development, server administration,
  video editing, and other operating systems. Also I spent a lot of time
  to study standards used in the PCB industry, eventually ending up as
  a contributor of the Gerber standard.\\

  And things like library management, platform specific problems or
  UI toolkit limitations make life hard, often turning simple appearing
  tasks into complicated tasks.
