\section{Next Steps}

\begin{frame}{\secname}
  \textbf{Short term:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item EAGLE project import as it is now abandoned by Autodesk
    \item Live part information (part status, stock availability, prices,
          \ldots)
    \item Under the hood: Qt6, C++17, 64-bit Windows binaries, \ldots
  \end{itemize}

  \bigskip

  \textbf{Long term (in arbitrary order):}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Improve trace routing tool (differential pairs, push\&shove router,
          \ldots)
    \item Hierarchical schematics \& buses
    \item Many UI improvements
    \item Extend part libraries
    \item Technology updates: OpenGL 2D renderer? QtQuick/QML? Rust?
    \item \ldots
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\note{
  The upcoming release will contain an EAGLE project importer, and there's
  currently some work ongoing to integrate live part information into
  the application, for example the livecycle status, stock availability and
  price. This would be a very useful feature so I really hope we can make it
  happen.\\

  Also it's clear that we should start moving from Qt5 to Qt6, and possibly
  more technology related updates.\\

  For long term, I think improvements on the trace routing tool and
  hierarchical schematics are a must have.\\

  And extending the part libraries is a never-ending story anyway.
